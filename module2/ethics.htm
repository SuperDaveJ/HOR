        <p class="style22">The Committee on Standards of Official   Conduct is a bipartisan Committee that gives advice to House Members, Officers,   and employees on ethics laws, rules, and standards of conduct.</p>
        <p class="style22">The Committee investigates possible   violations by Members, Officers, and employees of any law, rule, or standard of   conduct relating to their official conduct.&nbsp; They adjudicate such violations and   may recommend sanctions to the House.&nbsp; Additionally, they serve as the   supervising ethics office for the Ethics in Government Act and other provisions   of ethics law.</p>

Committee staff is available to provide <strong>informal advice</strong> over the   telephone, by e-mail, or in person, and the Committee will provide a <strong>formal   written opinion</strong> in response to a proper written inquiry.</p>
        <p class="style22">All communications are confidential.&nbsp; The   law states that no one is placed at risk by seeking Committee advice about   future conduct, and good-faith reliance on written Committee opinions protects   you from sanctions under House rules.</p>
