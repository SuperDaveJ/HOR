    <tr>
      <td width="650"><p class="style22">If you have been previously employed with   the Federal Government and are now returning, you may be eligible to elect   coverage under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) if you were covered by   CSRS or another Federal civilian retirement system on December 31, 1983, and if   separated on or after December 31, 1983, the break in services has been less   than 366 days, and you have not specified a refund of your contributions to the   CSRS or another Federal civilian retirement since June 14, 1984, and you have   not ceased to be covered by CSRS after December 21, 1983, while performing   service in the legislative branch.</p>
        <p class="style22">If you do not meet those requirements,   Social Security (FICA) will cover you, but you may also be eligible to   participate in the CSRS OFFSET System if you have five (5) years of creditable   Federal civilian service as of December 31, 1986.</p>
        <p class="style22">If you have been rehired after a break in   service of four (4) calendar days or more and meet the above eligibility   requirements, and elect such coverage, you may within six (6) months of being   rehired elect to transfer to the Federal Employees Retirement System   (FERS).</p>
        <p class="style22">If you are a new employee or do not meet   the above requirements, you will be covered by FERS.&nbsp; You do not need to   complete any forms to enroll in FERS.</p>
        <p class="style22"><strong>Thrift Savings Plan   (TSP)</strong></p>
        <p class="style22">Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is a retirement   savings and investment plan that offers House employees the same type of savings   and tax benefits that many private corporations offer their employees under   &ldquo;401(k)&rdquo; plans.&nbsp; TSP allows you to contribute a portion of your monthly salary   towards one of two retirement systems, based on your previous Federal service,   if any.&nbsp; These programs are the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the   Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS).</p>
        <p class="style22">You can elect to contribute to the TSP at   any time; there is no waiting period.&nbsp; However, the amount you can contribute   changes annually.&nbsp; You may elect to contribute any dollar amount or percentage   (1% to 100%) of your basic pay.&nbsp; However, your annual dollar total cannot exceed   the Internal Revenue Code limit, which is $15,500 for 2007.</p>
        <p class="style22">To enroll in the TSP and start   contributing, download the TSP-1 Form found on HouseNet by going to &ldquo;Personnel&rdquo;   and then to &ldquo;Retirement&rdquo;&mdash;and return it to CAO Employee Services in B-215   Longworth HOB.&nbsp; You can also access the TSP-1 Form by downloading it directly   from the TSP website:&nbsp; <a class="navThemeOn" href="http://www.tsp.gov" target="_blank">http://www.tsp.gov</a>.</p>
        <p class="style22">All contributions to your TSP account will   be initially invested in the Government Securities Investment (G) Fund, until   you choose to allocate your contributions differently.&nbsp; There are six different   funds in which you can invest:</p>
        <UL type="disc" class="style22">
          <LI>Government Securities Investment (G)   Fund   
          <LI>Fixed Income Index Investment (F)   Fund   
          <LI>Common Stock Index Investment (C)   Fund   
          <LI>Small Capitalization Stock Index   Investment (S) Fund   
          <LI>International Stock Index Investment (I)   Fund   
          <LI>Lifecycle (L) Funds </LI>
        </UL>
        <p class="style22">To view a detailed summary of these six   plans, and to access online information regarding TSP, please visit <a class="navThemeOn" href="http://www.tsp.gov" target="_blank">http://www.tsp.gov</a>.&nbsp; If you have any questions regarding TSP, please call   Employee Services at 202-228-1435.</p></td>
