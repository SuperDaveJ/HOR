		<p>To help satisfy your trivia interest, here are some interesting and often unknown facts and information about the House and the Capitol.</p>
		<ul class="style24">
            <li>
            The first live television broadcast from the       House Chamber occurred during the opening session of the 80th Congress (1947&ndash;1949).&nbsp;       President Harry Truman watched the two-hour broadcast on a special 10-inch       television set installed in the Oval Office, in preparation for his own       scheduled televised State of the Union Message (the first to be televised)       in the House Chamber three days later. </li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li class="style24">The C-SPAN network started       by cablecasting live from the U.S. House of Representatives with the first       C-SPAN cablecast on March&nbsp;19,&nbsp;1979.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <ul class="style24">
            <li>Seventeen Presidents have served in the U.S.       House of Representatives at some point in their careers. </li>
          </ul>
          <ul class="style24">
            <li>Seventeen former House members have served on       the U.S. Supreme Court. </li>
          </ul>
          <ul class="style24">
            <li>The shortest period of service on record for a       Speaker is one day.&nbsp; Despite the       fact that he was retiring the next day, Theodore Pomeroy of New York was elected       and sworn in to replace Schuyler Colfax, who had resigned to become Vice       President in the incoming Ulysses S. Grant administration.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li class="style24">Until the mid-19th century, Washington, DC had few buildings large       enough for public gatherings, and the House Chamber was often used as a       place of worship.<br>
              <br>
            </li>
            <li class="style24">The  first Congressional Gold Medal was awarded to General George Washington &ldquo;in  recognition of his wise and spirited conduct and the officers and soldiers  under his command, in the siege and acquisition of Boston.&rdquo; </li>
          </ul>
          <blockquote>
            <p><em>&ldquo;Resolved, That the thanks of  this Congress, in their own name, and in the name of the thirteen United  Colonies, whom they represent, be presented to His Excellency General  Washington, and the officers and soldiers under his command, for their wise and  spirited conduct in the siege and acquisition of Boston; and that a medal of  gold be struck in commemoration of this great event, and presented to His  Excellency; and that a committee of three be appointed to prepare a letter of  thanks and a proper device for the medal.&rdquo;</em></p>
          </blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li>Visitors  to the U.S. Capitol once paid admission to tour the building.&nbsp; From 1876 to 1971, the operations of the  Capitol Guide Service were supported entirely through charging a fee of  twenty-five cents per person for a tour of the Capitol (fifteen cents for  schoolchildren). The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970, brought the  Capitol Guide Service under the auspices of the Sergeants at Arms and the  Architect of the Capitol, and also eliminated any fee for tours.<br>
              <br>
            </li>
            <li>The  Mace, the official symbol of the Sergeant at Arms, was called for during the  first session of the First Congress of the United   States, which convened in New York City on March 4, 1789. Congress adopted a  resolution on April 14 providing that: </li>
          </ul>
          <blockquote>
            <p><em>&quot;A Sergeant at Arms shall  be appointed, to hold his office during the pleasure of the House, whose duty  it shall be to attend the House during its sitting, to execute the commands of  the House from time to time, and all such process, issued by authority thereof,  as shall be directed to him by the Speaker. A proper symbol of office shall be  provided for the Sergeant at Arms, of such form and device as the Speaker shall  direct, which shall be borne by the Sergeant when in the execution of his  office.&quot;</em></p>
          </blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li>The  current Mace used by the Sergeant at Arms is only the third used in the history  of the House of Representatives. The first Mace was destroyed when British  soldiers burned the Capitol on August 24, 1814. Its replacement, hastily  constructed of common pine and painted, was in use until the current Mace was  made in 1841.&nbsp; <br>
              <br>
            </li>
            <li>The present Mace was ordered on August 10, 1841, by Speaker John White  from William Adams, a New York  silversmith. This Mace was first used by the House of Representatives on  December 29, 1841. <br>
              <br>
            </li>
            <li>Each of  the state and territory seals in the ceiling of the House Chamber were once  made of stained glass.&nbsp; When the current  House chamber was constructed in 1857, the entire ceiling was basically a large  a glass and iron skylight&mdash;to admit natural light in the days before  electricity. Seals of each of the states&mdash;crafted in stained glass&mdash;were a  decorative element of this original ceiling <br>
              <br>
            </li>
            <li>By the 1940s, this original roof and ceiling was in need of replacement,  and by 1952, was replaced with the current roof. The original stained glass  state seals were removed and returned to each state. The seals one can see in  the ceiling of the House Chamber today are plaster copies of these original  stained glass state seals. <br>
              <br>
            </li>
            <li>The  Library of Congress was once located in the Capitol building&mdash;From 1800 until 1897,  the Library of Congress was housed in a variety of rooms in the original  section of the Capitol, perhaps most notably in the west center section of the  Capitol. Because of the enormous growth of the Library of Congress in the later  part of the Nineteenth Century, Congress authorized the construction of a  separate building in 1876. This building&mdash;what is now known as the Thomas Jefferson   Building&mdash;was opened on  November 1, 1897. <br>
              <br>
            </li>
            <li>The  first televised broadcast of the House of Representatives was in 1947&mdash;On  January 3, 1947, the opening day of the First Session of the Eightieth  Congress, television cameras were allowed to broadcast a small portion of the  session. This was the only television coverage allowed in the House of  Representatives until gavel-to-gavel coverage started on March 19, 1979. <br>
              <br>
            </li>
            <li>The  large painting of George Washington and Cornwallis located in the Members&rsquo;  Dining Room in the Capitol was once located in the House of Representatives  Chamber&mdash;Cornwallis Sues for Cessation of Hostilities under the Flag of Truce&rdquo;  is a work in fresco by the artist Constantino Brumidi. It was originally  painted on the wall of current House chamber, and was completed in December  1857. The fresco was covered over in the 1950s when the room was remodeled, and  was ultimately cut out of the wall and relocated to the present location in  1961.<br>
              <br>
            </li>
            <li>The  large painting of the &ldquo;Signing of the Constitution by Howard Chandler Christy,  which now hangs in the West Grand Staircase of the House side of the Capitol,  was dedicated and remained on display in the Rotunda for a year and a half. painting  was completed in 1940. A dedication ceremony was held in the Rotunda of the  Capitol, and the painting remained on display in this room for sixteen months   until it was moved to its current location. The  painting measures 18&rsquo; x 26&rsquo;, and is held in a 20&rsquo; x 30&rsquo; frame. <br>
