      <p>The Office of Identification Services provides identification cards to    permanent and temporary House of Representatives and Architect of the Capitol    (AOC) staff, interns, pages, fellows, detailees, as well as the Members and    the immediate family and spouses of Members of Congress.&nbsp; Vendors and contractors sponsored by a    House or AOC office are also issued identification badges.&nbsp; In addition, ID Services issues liaison    identification badges to paid employees of Executive Branch and other    Congressional support agencies who have a specific, frequent business need to    access the Capitol campus outside of public building hours.</p>
      <p><strong>Initial ID Badge</strong></p>
      <p>To obtain an ID card, new staff must follow this process:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
          <li>Fill out a 110th         Congress ID request form.</li>
        <li>Obtain the         signature of the employing Member (Officer) on the ID request form.</li>
        <li>Submit the form         to ID Services in person or by fax to 202-225-0239.&nbsp; Forms should be submitted at least         twenty-four (24) hours before an ID is required.&nbsp; This enables data entry to be         performed before the requesting staffer arrives at the ID Offices, and thereby         reduces waiting time.</li>
        <li>Presentation of         proper photo identification, which includes a valid driver&rsquo;s license,         non-driver&rsquo;s ID card, domestic or foreign passport, or U.S.         military card, will be required before an ID badge is issued.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Lost Identification    Cards</strong></p>
      <p>Lost ID cards must be reported to ID services, either by telephone or    in person.&nbsp; The reports should include the    cardholder&rsquo;s name, Social Security number, and fax number, so that an    affidavit for a lost ID may be completed.&nbsp;    Both the Member and cardholder MUST sign the affidavit.&nbsp; There is a waiting period of three (3)    business days from the time the ID card is reported to ID Services as lost or    stolen, before an ID will be reissued.</p>
      <p><strong>Temporary    Identification Stickers</strong></p>
      <p>Permanent staff may get a temporary ID by reporting to the Capitol    Police House Division Detail Office, located in B-220 Longworth House Office    Building.&nbsp; Please be prepared to    present photo identification in order to receive a temporary ID.&nbsp; In addition, your employment status will be    verified prior to issuance of the temporary ID.</p>

      <p><strong>House Parking Program</strong></p>
      <p>Parking space allocations for each House office are determined by the    Committee on House Administration.&nbsp; In    addition to House offices, employees of the Architect of the Capitol and U.S.    Capitol Police are eligible to park in House permit-only areas.</p>
      <p>Staff receiving a Metro subsidy are not eligible for parking permits&mdash;permanent    or temporary.</p>
      <p><strong>How to Get a Parking    Permit</strong></p>
      <p>Employees are authorized for parking permits by their employing    office.&nbsp; When an office parking    administrator assigns a permit to an employee, notification of the assignment    authorizing the employee and the vehicle to park is submitted on office    letterhead, signed by the employing authority (Member or Officer), and sent    to the Director, House Garages and Parking Security.&nbsp; The notification should include the parking    permit number from the office&rsquo;s parking roster; the employee&rsquo;s name; the    make, model, and color of the vehicle; and the license plate    information.&nbsp; There is no charge for a    non-reserved parking spot.</p>
      <p>Staff wanting to reserve their indoor parking spaces should submit    their requests in writing to the House Garages and Parking Security Office    and include their current parking assignments and employee identification    numbers.&nbsp; This must be received by the    10th day of the month to be effective for that month&rsquo;s payroll.&nbsp; Similarly, to cancel a reserved parking    space, House Garages and Parking Security Office must be notified by the 10th    day of a month to be effective for that month.</p>

        <p><strong>Workers&rsquo;    Compensation</strong></p>
      <p>The Federal Employees&rsquo; Compensation Act (FECA) is a law which provides    compensation benefits to civilian employees of the United States for disability due    to personal injury (including occupational disease) sustained in the    performance of duty. Damage to or destruction of medical braces, artificial    limbs, and other prosthetic devices incidental to a personal injury are also    compensable. The FECA also provides for the payment of benefits to dependents    if job-related injury or disease causes the employee&rsquo;s death. &nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Injuries on the Job</strong></p>
      <p>Please contact the Employee Services Generalist in the Office of    Employee Services at 202-225-1435.&nbsp; The    Generalist will help you with the appropriate forms and with the filing of    claims with the Department of Labor.&nbsp;    All forms and bills are to be submitted through the Office of Employee    Services, and not directly to the Department of Labor.</p>

      <p>Instructions attached to Forms CA-1 and CA-2 should be followed    carefully. Form CA-1 should be filed within 30 days of the injury, and Form    CA-2 should be filed within 30 days of the date the employee realized the    disease or illness was caused or aggravated by his or her employment.

      <p><strong>Office Emergency    Coordinators</strong></p>
      <p>Each office identifies a primary Office Emergency Coordinator (OEC)    who is the focal point for emergency planning and preparedness for House    offices. An alternate is also identified.</p>
      <p>An OEC plays a critical role in preparing staff for emergencies that    could arise at any time.&nbsp; Active    involvement in the House Emergency Preparedness Program could mean the    difference between a calm, orderly response to an emergency and the confused,    chaotic response often seen when people are unprepared to deal with a crisis.</p>
      <ul type="disc">
          <li>Know who your         office emergency coordinator is.</li>
        <li>Know the         evacuation route from your office and other offices and/or buildings         that you frequent.</li>
        <li>Know where your         office primary and alternate Assembly Areas are located.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Evacuations/Evacuation    Drills</strong></p>
      <p>Evacuation is a common and highly effective protective action taken in    response to a threat to an occupied building.&nbsp;    Evacuation involves moving personnel to a safe location away from a    threatened building.</p>
      <p>In the event of an evacuation, you will be directed by one or more of    the following: building fire alarms, wireless emergency annunciator system,    building public address system, or U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) officers.&nbsp; You may receive follow-up notifications    using a variety of communications media.&nbsp;    During an evacuation or evacuation drill, all office staff should move    to the appropriate Assembly Area using defined evacuation routes.&nbsp; OECs will then account for all office    personnel and report status to the USCP.&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Staff not in their normal office areas at the time of an evacuation    should evacuate according to the routes and procedures for the areas in which    they are. </p>
      <p><u>Back to top</u></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Emergency Evacuation    Routes</strong></p>
      <p>Evacuation maps are available in the Office of Emergency Coordinator    (OEC) Desk Reference and in the Emergency Procedures pamphlet.&nbsp; For additional information, contact OEPPO    at 202-226-0950.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Mobility Impaired</strong></p>
      <p>One elevator in each building has been designated as a Primary    Emergency Evacuation Elevator.&nbsp; An    alternate elevator has been designated in the event that the primary is not    available.&nbsp; Each of these elevators is    marked with a blue mobility-impaired staging area sign.&nbsp; Please locate these elevators in your    building and contact your OEC or OEPPO for additional information.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Shelter-in-Place/Relocate</strong></p>
      <p>Shelter-in-Place means to take refuge inside, if leaving your office    or building may put you in harm&rsquo;s way.&nbsp;    Sheltering-in-Place is a way to keep you safe until help arrives or    the incident is resolved.</p>
      <p>A shelter can be an office, conference room, hallway, restroom,    stairwell, or other location in which persons remain when an emergency    warrants.&nbsp; You should always follow the    directions given by the USCP.</p>
      <p><u>Back to top</u></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Escape Hoods</strong></p>
      <p>You may be asked to don (put on) protective equipment to ensure a safe    breathing environment if there is a respiratory threat from a chemical or    biological agent, or radiological particulate hazard.&nbsp; All House offices have been issued the new    escape hoods.&nbsp; They are typically    stored in your office in black rolling duffle bags with identification    tags.&nbsp; There are also many public    caches throughout the Capitol Complex that contain escape hoods for Members,    staff, and visitors.&nbsp; Baby escape hoods    are also available in the public caches.</p>
      <p>It&rsquo;s critical that you know:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
          <li>How to don an         escape hood</li>
        <li>Where the escape         hoods are stored in your office</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Training is offered by the OEPPO.&nbsp;    A training video is available on their Web site at <u>http://test.oeppo.house.gov/multimedia.aspx</u>.&nbsp; Minimal training is required, because of    the ease of use of the escape hood.&nbsp; Demonstrations    are available upon request.</p>
