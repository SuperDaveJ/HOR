        <p class="style22"><strong><strong><a name="caadrp" id="caadrp"></a></strong>Congressional Accountability Act Dispute Resolution Process</strong></p>
        <p>The CAA  provides a mandatory dispute resolution process of counseling and mediation for  the settling of disputes. If the parties involved are not able to resolve their  dispute through counseling and mediation, an employee may either pursue a  non-judicial administrative hearing process with the Office of Compliance or  file suit in Federal court. The administrative hearing process offers speedier  resolution and greater confidentiality than a Federal civil suit, while still offering  the same remedies that a court can provide.</p>
        <p>The dispute  resolution process is a multi-step process. All employees, including district  office staff, must follow established dispute resolution procedures in order to  process their claims under the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA). Only  after an employee has engaged in the required counseling and mediation can a  remedy be granted. The failure to follow these procedures or to meet  established time lines may jeopardize any claims raised under the CAA.</p>
        <p>This is  only a brief description of the dispute resolution process. For complete  information on the rights, procedures, and remedies established by the CAA,  refer to the Congressional Accountability Act (2 U.S.C. 1301 et seq.) and the  Office of Compliance Procedural Rules. The text of the CAA and the complete  procedural rules of the Office of Compliance are available in the <em>eHandbook </em>on  CD-ROM and on the Office of Compliance web site. Printed copies are also  available upon request.</p>

        <p class="style22"><strong><strong><a name="uawe" id="uawe"></a></strong>Understanding At-Will Employment</strong></p>
        <p class="style22">It  is important to remember that most employees in Congress are &lsquo;at-will&rsquo;  employees. This means that you as an employee are not under contract and can  leave your job at any time. But is also means that your employer can terminate  you at any time, and does not necessarily have to provide a reason for  termination. The CAA can protect you only when your termination can be proven  to be motivated by something prohibited by the CAA, such as discrimination  based on our race, age, sex, etc.</p>
